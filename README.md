# DATA ANALYST | BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE ANALYST | HEALTHCARE ANALYST  

## About Me  
Hey there! Your Bestie here, My name is **Abani Favour Elemchi**, a girl who believes numbers tell better stories than words (but I'll still try to make this fun!). Somehow, I have been able to pivot from Nursing to Numbers â€“ I started in healthcare, ensuring patients got the best care, but then I discovered the power of data analytics.  

My journey started in **nursing**, where I developed a deep understanding of peopleâ€™s needs through clinical workflows and the challenges faced in the healthcare system. Over time, I realized that beyond bedside care, **data-driven decision-making** plays a crucial role in improving general outcomes. This realization led me to explore **data analytics**, where I now bridge the gap between problems and solutions.  

Now, with expertise in **Power BI, Excel, SQL, and Python**, I help turn complex **healthcare data and business data** into insights that improve outcomes, optimize processes, and (hopefully) make everyone's life easier!  

Currently, I'm working as a **data analyst intern**, refining my skills in **data visualization, statistical analysis, and business intelligence**. I love tackling challenges, solving problems, and continuously learning new tools and techniques to stay ahead in the field.  

When I'm not immersed in data, you can find me exploring **new tech trends**, engaging in **professional development**, or sharing **insights with fellow data enthusiasts**. I believe in lifelong learning, collaboration, and making data work for the betterment of everyone regardless of the sector.

Let's connect, besties, and turn data into impactful **healthcare and business solutions**!
